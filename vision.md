D&D Companion App - Vision Document

🎯 Mission
Transform D&D from overwhelming complexity into an engaging, learnable experience for first-time players.

👥 Target User
New D&D players during their first campaign who feel intimidated by combat mechanics and action economy rules.

⚡ Core Problem
Traditional D&D interfaces show too much information at once, causing decision paralysis and confusion about what actions can be combined in a single turn.
D&D should be fun! But often you get bogged down in the weeds of the mechanics of the game.
